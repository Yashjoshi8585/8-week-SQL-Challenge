I'm currently doing SQL challenge by Danny.

Case study questions and answers/solutions for [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ "8 Week SQL Challenge") by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/ "Data With Danny")

This repository contains all of my SQL submissions for the [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/ "8 Week SQL Challenge") created by [Danny Ma](https://www.datawithdanny.com/ "Data With Danny").

In the summer of 2023 I did Danny's Challenge and I found it to be the best SQL exercises found on the web.  Many times I had to review other peoples work to figure out how to exactly get the correct answers.  This challenge pushes you beyond basic SQL and into intermediate/advance SQL techniques.
